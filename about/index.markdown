This is a collection of research and thinking on eccentric engineering.

Eccentric engineering reimagines technologies to address their scope. It is creative work that rethinks how we design and engineer and who is included and excluded in these processes and the resultant technologies. Eccentric engineering asks questions such as - how can we build systems that enact more-than-only-human agendas? How can we redesign infrastructures based on mutualism? How can technologies be repurposed to include more diverse agendas and perspectives, particularly those of disenfranchised or underrepresented communities?

How can we engineer with others?  

Eccentric engineering describes atypical and out-of-centre engineering practices that attempt to rethink how we assess success and failure in our systems and structure new forms of coexistence between human and non-human communities.
