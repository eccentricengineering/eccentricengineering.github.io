This is a collection of research and thinking on eccentric engineering.

Eccentric engineering is engineering for and with others. It is creative work that rethinks how we design and engineer, exploring how technologies can enact more-than-human agendas and mutually benefit both humans and non-humans organisms. Eccentric engineering attempts to decenter the human in how we assess success and failure in the systems, tools and devices we build.

This project is currently in development at [Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology](http://eyebeam.org/).
