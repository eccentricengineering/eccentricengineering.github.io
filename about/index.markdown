This is a collection of research and thinking on eccentric engineering.

Eccentric engineering reimagines technologies to address their scope and politics. It is creative work that rethinks how we design and engineer and who is included and excluded in these processes. How we might build systems that enact more-than-only-human agendas? What do infrastructures based on mutualism look like? How can technologies be repurposed to include more diverse agendas and perspectives, particularly those of disenfranchised or underrepresented communities? **How can we engineer with others?** 

Eccentric engineering attempts to rethink how we assess success and failure in the systems, tools and devices we build to structure new forms of coexistence.

This project is currently in development at [Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology](http://eyebeam.org/).
