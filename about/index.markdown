This is a place for research and thinking on the concept of eccentric engineering. Eccentric engineering is creative work that attempts to rethink how we design and engineer technologies. It attempts to decenter the human in how we assess success and failure in the systems, tools and devices we build. How can technologies enact other agendas or mutually benefit both humans and non-humans concurrently?

This project is currently in development at [Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology](http://eyebeam.org/).
