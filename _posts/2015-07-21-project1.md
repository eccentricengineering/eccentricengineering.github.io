I've been thinking allot about wireless connectivity and our sensitivity to this connection. A dip in the subway requires preparation, we notice when
our data gets slow and have a nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

We approach our networks with expectations of consistency and speed. Fast. Always on. Seamless. And when there's a break in connection, shit gets real. I confess, I've thrown
more than one tantrum at a break in network. And yet natural systems ebb and flow. We are entrained to their rhythms and oscillations. We are relived when the
