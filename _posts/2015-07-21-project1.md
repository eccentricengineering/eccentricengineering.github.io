I've been thinking allot about WiFi and our sensitivity to wireless network connections. A trip in the subway requires preparation, we notice when
our data gets slow in WiFi shadows and we have a nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

We expect our networks to be fast and consistent. Always on. Seamless. And when there's a break in connection, shit gets real. I confess that I've thrown
more than one tantrum when the WiFi goes down. It also makes me talk to my flatmate. And yet natural systems ebb and flow. We are entrained to unearthly rhythms and oscillations. We are relived when the sun goes down and we can start again.

Over in the UK [they are worried about](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27536-the-internet-is-running-out-of-room-but-we-can-save-it/) running out of Internet and some say they might actually need to ration it. Apparently Internet media use could also use all of the nation's electricity by 2035. So much for the ethereal cloud that appears as if by magic from nowhere.

What if our networks worked differently? Could connectivity be rhythmic, cyclical? What if we had to plan
when we were going to use it as it just might not be on all the time?

We divide up wireless frequencies to ensure there is enough of the spectrum to go around just like a group of species do in an ecosystem - this is the basis of acoustic ecology.

Ecologists can [analyse the soundscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology) of different environments and have noticed that gaps in bands of frequencies often indicates that the environment is disturbed and there are species gone missing. Kinda like if we just turned off all the mobile phone networks at once.
