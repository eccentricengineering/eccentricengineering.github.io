I've been thinking allot about WiFi our sensitivity to these network connections. A dip in the subway requires preparation, we notice when
our data gets slow and we have a nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

We approach our networks with expectations of consistency and speed. Fast. Always on. Seamless. And when there's a break in connection, shit gets real. I confess, I've thrown
more than one tantrum at a break in network. And yet natural systems ebb and flow. We are entrained to their rhythms and oscillations. We are relived when the sun goes down and we can start again.

Over in the UK they are worried about running out of Internet AND MIGHT NEED TO RATION IT! Apparently Internet media use could also use all of the nation's electricity by 2035. So much for the ethereal cloud that appears as if by magic from nowhere.

What if our networks worked differently? Could connectivity be rhythmic, cyclical? What if we had to plan
when we were going to use it as it just might not be on all the time?

We divide up wireless frequencies to ensure there is enough of the spectrum to go around just like a group of species do in an ecosystem - this is the basis of acoustic ecology.

Ecologists can analyse the frequencies in different environments and if there are gaps in sound frequencies then it's a sign that the environment is disturbed and there are species gone missing. Kinda like if we just turned off all the mobile phone networks at once.
