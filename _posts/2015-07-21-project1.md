I've been thinking allot about WiFi and our increasing sensitivity to wireless network connections. A trip through the quiet zone of the subway requires preparation, I notice when
my data gets slow in WiFi shadows and I have developed nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

I expect my network connections to be fast and consistent. Seamless. Always on. And when there's a break in connection, things get hairy and suddenly I can't find my way to Dumbo. I'll confess to more than one tantrum when my phone runs flat or when the network goes down. But it's also in these moments that I talk to my neighbors and actually read books. Yet this expectation of constant connection is strange. If we look to natural systems, almost everything ebbs and flows with oscillations that we usually try to dampen with technics (think of temperature control within buildings). Yet we are entrained to earthly and unearthly rhythms and cycles whether we care to admit it or not. It is often a relief to watch the sun go down and to start again.

In the UK [they are worried about](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27536-the-internet-is-running-out-of-room-but-we-can-save-it/) running out of Internet and suggestions are floating around that service providers might actually need to ration it in the future. Apparently Internet media use could also grow to use all of the nation's electricity by 2035 based on current trends. Oh yeah that's right, I forgot we live in a finite system! So much for the ethereal cloud that appears as if by magic from nowhere.

But what if our networks worked differently? Could connectivity be rhythmic, cyclical? What if we had to plan
when we were going to connect as the network just might not be there all the time? This question is so far from the rhetoric of the suits in the Silicon Valley it actually seems laughable.

Yet the world is finite. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) know this being the two groups responsible for dividing up the radio spectrum to ensure there is enough frequency space to go around. Different species in an ecosystem do this informally in the range of sound and over millennia of evolution, species sharing an environment spread their sounds out over the sound range in order to communicate more clearly. This is the basis of acoustic ecology.

Ecologists who [analyse the soundscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology) of different environments have noticed that gaps in bands of sound frequencies often indicate that an environment is disturbed and that it's likely that there were species with calls that would have once occupied that range who are now missing. Like the gap that would result in the radio spectrum if we turned off all the mobile phone networks or all the FM radio stations. The distribution of the commons is the ongoing drama of ecology.

My project at Eyebeam sits somewhere at these crossroads. It considers communications in the now cherished frequency range of WiFi and I'm exploring the design of our interaction with wireless networks and how our expectations of these technologies might be leveraged in different ways. _Media are not only devices of information; they are also agencies of order._ -that's John Durham Peters whose analysis of environments as media has me deeply enraptured. His discussion of the politics, affordances and visibilities of infrastructures is also deeply relevant to this project. _Not everyone reads the sky, makes records, or sets the clock but those who do arrange the infrastructural settings for the rest of us._  

So how might we pull apart these typically invisible infrastructural settings and check that they are making the world we want? I know, it's a huge question but an important one to consider even in modest ways. And so I'm spending what's left of the summer rethinking and reprogramming WiFi routers and experimenting with ways they might be different, particularly how I might represent non-human systems within their operation.
