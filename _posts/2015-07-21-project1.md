I've been thinking allot about WiFi and our sensitivity to wireless network connections. A trip through the quiet zone of the subway requires preparation, we notice when
our data gets slow in WiFi shadows and we have a nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

We expect our networks to be fast and consistent. Always on. Seamless. And when there's a break in connection, shit gets real. I'll confess to more than one tantrum when the network goes down. But its also in these moments that I talk to my flatmates and actually read books. If we look to natural systems, they ebb and flow with oscillations we try to dampen with our technics. Yet we are entrained to unearthly rhythms and cycles. It is often a relief to watch the sun go down and start again.

Over in the UK [they are worried about](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27536-the-internet-is-running-out-of-room-but-we-can-save-it/) running out of Internet and suggestions are floating around that service providers might actually need to ration it. Apparently Internet media use could also use all of the nation's electricity by 2035. So much for the ethereal cloud that appears as if by magic from nowhere.

What if our networks worked differently? Could connectivity be rhythmic, cyclical? What if we had to plan
when we were going to connect as the network just might not be on all the time?

We divide up wireless frequencies to ensure there is enough of the spectrum to go around just like a groups of species do in the frequency range of sound within an ecosystem. This is the basis of acoustic ecology.

Ecologists who [analyse the soundscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology) of different environments have noticed that gaps in bands of frequencies often indicate that an environment is disturbed and there are species gone missing. Kind of like if we turned off all the mobile phone networks at once.

My project at Eyebeam considers one of our most cherished frequency ranges, that of WiFi and explores interactions with wireless networks. I'm rethinking and redesigning WiFi routers trying to represent the presence of non-human systems within their operation.
