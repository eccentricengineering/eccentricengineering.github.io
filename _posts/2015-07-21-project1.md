I've been thinking allot about WiFi and our sensitivity to wireless network connections. A trip through the quiet zone of the subway requires preparation, we notice when
our data gets slow in WiFi shadows and we have a nuanced sensitivity as to the data footprints of various media.

We expect our networks to be fast and consistent. Always on. Seamless. And when there's a break in connection, shit gets real. I'll confess to more than one tantrum when the network goes down. But it's also in these moments that I talk to my flatmates and actually read books. If we look to natural systems they ebb and flow with oscillations that we often try to dampen with our technics. Yet we are entrained to unearthly rhythms and cycles whether we care to admit it or not. And it is often a relief to watch the sun go down and start again.

In the UK [they are worried about](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27536-the-internet-is-running-out-of-room-but-we-can-save-it/) running out of Internet and suggestions are floating around that service providers might actually need to ration it in the future. Apparently Internet media use could also use all of the nation's electricity by 2035 based on current trends. Oh yeah that's right, we live in a finite system. So much for the ethereal cloud that appears as if by magic from nowhere.

What if our networks worked differently? Could connectivity be rhythmic, cyclical? What if we had to plan
when we were going to connect as the network just might not be there all the time? This question is so far from the rhetoric of the suits in the Silicon Valley it actually seems laughable.

Yet the world is finite. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are the two groups responsible for dividing up the radio spectrum to ensure there is enough to go around. Different species in an ecosystem do this informally in the frequency range of sound and over millennia of evolution, move to specific frequency ranges in order to communicate. This is the basis of acoustic ecology.

Ecologists who [analyse the soundscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundscape_ecology) of different environments have noticed that gaps in bands of sound frequencies often indicate that an environment is disturbed and that there are species gone missing. Kind of like the gap that would result in the radiospectrum if we turned off all the mobile phone networks at once or all the FM radio stations. The distribution of the commons of coexistence.

My project at Eyebeam sits at these crossroads. It considers the cherished frequency ranges of WiFi and exploring our interactions with wireless networks. I'm rethinking and redesigning WiFi routers trying to represent non-human systems within their operation.
