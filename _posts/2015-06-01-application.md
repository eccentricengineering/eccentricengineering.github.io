Technologies afford winners and losers. They are dynamic entities that coproduce environments and cultures through both material, psychological and (more recently) algorithmic interactions that privilege certain agendas and perspectives. Can we move beyond thinking of technologies in exclusively in human terms, and re-conceive systems, infrastructures and devices that include, accommodate and amplify the experience of those not typically included in their scope?

How can human systems, infrastructures and devices be re-conceived to accommodate the perspectives & agendas of non-humans? In response to this question, this project focuses on developing experimental technologies, devices or softwares that tie personal experience to that of a non-human’s.

In this residency I propose to build prototype devices, as well as research & articulate this expanded practice of non-human-centric engineering - practices I call ‘eccentric engineering’. Eccentric engineering is about building inter-structures rather than infra-structures. It is post-disciplinary research and development of experimental technologies that privilege empathy over efficiency, foster co-dependence over independence & reveal connections rather than reinstating false separations.

Eccentric engineering approaches infrastructures not as services to human communities but as negotiations with non-human communities. It takes lessons learned in human-computer interaction and applies them to thinking about human organism interaction (HOI). These ideas can be traced in strands of media art, and my thinking & research of such practices will be collated & communicated online as a part of this project blog & writing. To explore these ideas I am developing experimental devices.
