Here are a few examples of eccentric engineering I've been collecting. This collection is drawn mostly from the work of artists creating technologies for others. I am going to post details of projects from other disciplines in the coming weeks.

Spela Petric has a number of works that realise eccentric design ideas. In particular is this piece [Naval Gazing, 2014](http://www.spelapetric.org/portfolio/naval-gazing/#) which she describes as an example of non-human architecture.

"The habiton is a kinetic kunst-machine, which simultaneously acts as a platform for the attachment of organisms, creating a travelling, uncontrollable transient biotope in the north sea." What's interesting about this piece and is that it is non-specific infrastructure. It is a technological intervention that is intentionally agnostic to lifeforms and thus functions as a sort of ambiguous art/biology experiment.

Petric is also in the artist team behind the [Plant Sex Consultancy, 2014](http://psx-consultancy.com/), a project developing erotic technologies for plants. Working with Pei-Ying Lin, Dimitris Stamatis and Jasmina Weiss, this work augments vegetal reproduction strategies with delightful appendages and charming 3d printed strap ons.

With a slightly different agenda of non-human communication technologies,
[Danger, Squirrel Nutkin!, 2009](http://www.ingramclockworks.com/machines/2009_squirrel.html) is a wonderful project by Ian Ingram and is a robotic squirrel warning system.
