*Sputniko, Menstuation Machine*
[Menstruation Machine](http://sputniko.com/2011/08/menstruation-machine-takashis-take-2010/) is a prosthesis that simulates the experience of menstruation. With a blood dispensing mechanism and electrodes to cause abdomenal pain, this device attends to the ongoing bias towards the masculine in how and why technologies are developed and deployed. Sputniko notes that in Japan -

<i>"New pills such as Lybrel and Seasonique, which reduce the frequency of menstruation to none or 4 times a year have recently been developed, but they are not yet widely used...It only took the Ministry of Health only 6 months to approve Viagra, but it took them more than 9 years to approve the contraceptive pill in 1999 (which was approved 3 months after the approval of Viagra). It is quite clear that the advancement of technology can be heavily influenced by political, social and cultural backgrounds of the time."</i>

*Natalie Jermeijenko, Green Light*
Much of Natalie Jeremijenko's work attempts to connect humans and non-humans in novel, entertaining ways and introduce non-human agendas into human systems. I've chosen this piece [Green Light](http://www.environmentalhealthclinic.net/greenlight) as it is an example of a device with a coupled agenda, in that it supports both vegetation and humans, porting sunlight collected outside.

*Coin-Operated Wetland*
My own work [Coin Operated Wetland](http://tegabrain.com/Coin-Operated-Wetland) also continues this thinking on infrastructures that structure mutualistic relationships with other organisms.

It is a large scale installation that takes the form of a closed water system, where a wetland is coupled with a laundromat so that both human and wetland benefit from one another. This project crystalises a design approach based on compromise, where efficiencies are traded for technologies that benefit more than only humans.
