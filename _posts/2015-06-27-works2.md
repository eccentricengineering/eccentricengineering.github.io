[Menstruation Machine](http://sputniko.com/2011/08/menstruation-machine-takashis-take-2010/) is a prosthesis that simulates the experience of menstruation. With a blood dispensing mechanism and electrodes to cause abdomenal pain, this device is designed to attend to the continued bias towards the masculine within how and why technololgies are developed and deployed. Sputniko observes:

<i>"New pills such as Lybrel and Seasonique, which reduce the frequency of menstruation to none or 4 times a year have recently been developed, but they are not yet widely used...It only took the Ministry of Health only 6 months to approve Viagra, but it took them more than 9 years to approve the contraceptive pill in 1999 (which was approved 3 months after the approval of Viagra). It is quite clear that the advancement of technology can be heavily influenced by political, social and cultural backgrounds of the time."</i>
