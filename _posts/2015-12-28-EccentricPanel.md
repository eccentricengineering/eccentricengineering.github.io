I recently curated and hosted a panel on Eccentric Engineering at Eyebeam's South Street Seaport space, inviting artists [Karolina Soebecka](http://www.gravitytrap.com/), [Danja Vasiliev](http://k0a1a.net/) and [Ramsey Nasser](http://nas.sr/) to discuss recent experiments, exploring infrastructural space from eccentric and critical perspectives. Karolina spoke of her recent work on geo-engineering, including projects on [cloud seeding](http://www.amateurhuman.org/cloud-machine) and [technologies to support cloud bacteria.](http://www.amateurhuman.org/featured/inp-ice-nucleating-protein-tests) Ramsey described the trials and tribulations of trying to create a [programming language in Arabic](http://nas.sr/%D9%82%D9%84%D8%A8/) as well as presenting re-Kindle which is an attempt to [hack the kindle](http://observer.com/2015/12/kindle-maps-hack/) and Danja talked about the philosophy and goals behind the [critical engineering manifesto](https://criticalengineering.org/). What. a. line-up.

[Details of the event are here.](https://eyebeam.org/events/eccentric-engineering) with more documentation will be posted soon.
