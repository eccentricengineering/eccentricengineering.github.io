I've been collecting examples of eccentric engineering. The following projects are mostly artists creating technologies for others. I am going to post details of projects from other disciplines in the coming weeks to give multiple perspectives on these ideas.

Spela Petric has a number of works that realise eccentric design ideas. In particular is this piece [Naval Gazing, 2014](http://www.spelapetric.org/portfolio/naval-gazing/#) which she describes as an example of non-human architecture.

"The habiton is a kinetic kunst-machine, which simultaneously acts as a platform for the attachment of organisms, creating a travelling, uncontrollable transient biotope in the north sea." What's interesting about this piece and is that it is non-specific infrastructure. It is a technological intervention that is intentionally agnostic to lifeforms and thus functions as a sort of ambiguous art/biology experiment.


Petric is also in the artist team behind the [Plant Sex Consultancy, 2014](http://psx-consultancy.com/), a project developing erotic technologies for plants. Working with Pei-Ying Lin, Dimitris Stamatis and Jasmina Weiss, this work augments vegetal reproduction strategies with delightful appendages and charming 3d printed strap ons.

[Danger, Squirrel Nutkin!, 2009](http://www.ingramclockworks.com/machines/2009_squirrel.html) sees the development of non-human communication technologies. Made by Ian Ingram, it is a robotic squirrel warning system.

Finnish artist Terike Haapoja is particularly inspiring for her rich collaborations with forestry scientists. The resultant works reimagine scientific instruments and measurement techniques in novel and evocative ways. [Dialogue, 2008](http://www.terikehaapoja.net/dialogue/) is one of several in a series that engages with techniques used by environmental scientists to measure carbon and oxygen exchange by different organisms. Dialogue consists of an device for a tree which measures it's respiration and also enables the viewer to communicate with it by whistling. When the visitor whistles to the trees they response by whistling back.

In a similar vein, [Botanicalls](http://www.botanicalls.com/) is a sensor platform to be installed in a house plant. The board measures soil moisture and will text you if your plant needs water.
