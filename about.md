This is a research blog investigating eccentric engineering. Eccentric engineering attempts to decentre  the human in how we assess success and failure in the systems, tools and devices we build. How can technologies reflect the agenda of non-humans as well as humans?

This project is currently being developed in a residency at Eyebeam Center for Art and Technology.
